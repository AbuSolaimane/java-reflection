## What is Reflection?

Java Reflection allows you to inspect and interact with the structure, behavior, and metadata of classes at runtime. It provides a way to obtain class information, such as methods, fields, constructors, etc., dynamically.

## Getting Started

To use reflection in Java, you need to work with the `java.lang.reflect` package. Here are the basic steps to get started:

1. **Obtain Class Object:**
   - Use `Class.forName("fully.qualified.ClassName")` or `ClassName.class` to obtain a `Class` object.

2. **Inspect Class:**
   - Use methods like `getMethods()`, `getFields()`, `getConstructors()`, etc., to inspect the class.

3. **Instantiate Objects:**
   - Create instances using the obtained `Class` object and manipulate them dynamically.

## Working with Classes

Use the `Class` class to get information about classes. Example:

```java
Class<?> myClass = MyClass.class;
